# ORB-SLAM3

### V1.0, December 22th, 2021
**Authors:** Carlos Campos, Richard Elvira, Juan J. Gómez Rodríguez, [José M. M. Montiel](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~josemari/), [Juan D. Tardos](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~jdtardos/).

The [Changelog](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3/blob/master/Changelog.md) describes the features of each version.

ORB-SLAM3 is the first real-time SLAM library able to perform **Visual, Visual-Inertial and Multi-Map SLAM** with **monocular, stereo and RGB-D** cameras, using **pin-hole and fisheye** lens models. In all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate.
